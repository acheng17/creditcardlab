//1. take the inputted string of the number sequence and make the process start at the very back. 
//2. identify all the even placed numbers and double them. 
//If double digits, add the digits together. Add all the final numbers together
//3. identify all the odd placed numbers and add them all together. 
//4. add the two sums from the evens and the odds together. 
//5. divide the total sum by 10 and check if the remainder is 0. 
//6. if remainder = 0, the number is valid, and if not, it's not vaid. 
//7. to check for card type, check if the first digit(s) match the ones for the card comp, 
//and return that company name. If it doesn't match any, say no company.
